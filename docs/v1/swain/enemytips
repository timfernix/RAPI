["Swain's passive is very potent if you are immobilized. Make sure to be extra careful around enemies who have immobilizing effects.","High mobility counters all of Swain's basic abilities: Death's Hand does more damage the closer he is, Vision of Empire has a very long delay and Nevermove must start returning back to him to be dangerous.","Buying an item with Grievous Wounds will make Swain much easier to kill during his Demonic Ascension."]
