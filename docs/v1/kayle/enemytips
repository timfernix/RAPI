["Divine Judgment only grants Kayle or her allies immunity to damage. Slows and stuns can still be applied, so trap them if they're being overzealous.","Kayle is usually a fragile target. If you see her ultimate cast on an ally, switch to attacking her.","Kayle starts the game as a weaker melee champion. Try to put her behind before she ascends to her ranged form."]
