["Try to take Vladimir down before Hemoplague detonates, as it will heal him for each afflicted enemy Champion.","Making Vladimir use Sanguine Pool at the start of a fight will maximize the Health cost of the ability to him.","Items that counter Health stacking, such as Liandry's Torment and Blade of the Ruined King, are very effective against Vladimir."]
