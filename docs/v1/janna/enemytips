["Save an interrupt ability for when Janna uses her ultimate.","Listen for the charge up sound on Howling Gale in case Janna is trying to hit you with it from off screen or from brush.","Janna's at her strongest when buffing another ally. If you can harass her ally, it will weaken her ability to fight you."]
