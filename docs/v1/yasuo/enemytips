["Steel Tempest is very narrow. Dodge laterally if possible. ","When Yasuo lands two Steel Tempests in a row, his next will fire a tornado. Watch and listen for the associated sound to prepare to dodge.","Yasuo is at his weakest just after he has launched a whirlwind. Engage at that point.","Yasuo's shield from Resolve lasts only 2 seconds. Dealing damage to him will trigger it. Wait it out, then engage."]
