["Zyra's seeds can be destroyed by stepping on them. If she tries to grow them as you do, dodge back at the last moment. ","Moving closer to Zyra can be a smart move if she places plants too far away from herself.","Plants take fixed damage from attacks and effects, similar to wards. They also expire quickly on their own.","Moving the fight to a different area will deprive Zyra of accumulated seeds.","Seeds placed by Zyra's W are larger, a different color, and grant a small amount of vision to her team."]
