["Tormented Shadow deals tons of damage to units missing large amounts of Health. When low on Health, be wary of Morgana's attempts to trap you within its reach.","Morgana often needs to land Dark Binding to setup her other attacks. Use your minions as shields against Dark Binding.","Black Shield makes Morgana immune to disabling effects, but can be broken with magic damage."]
