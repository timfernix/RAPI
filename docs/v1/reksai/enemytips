["If you see one of Rek'Sai's tunnels, briefly stand on one of the entrances to destroy it.","Rek'Sai's Furious Bite gains damage as she builds Fury. Be very careful around her when her Fury is full.","When Rek'Sai is near, she can see the position of you and your allies, but only if you're moving."]
