["Lucian has strong burst, but little sustained damage.","Lucian cannot change the aim of The Culling. Take advantage of this by avoiding the angle of the bullets.","Piercing Light does not give Lucian extra Attack Range. He still needs to find a target in range to line up his shot. Avoid Piercing Light by anticipating the angle Lucian will choose."]
