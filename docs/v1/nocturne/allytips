["Using Paranoia at a critical moment is well worth it even if you cannot use the dash.","Duskbringer isn't only an offensive ability. It can be used to close distance out of combat or escape from certain death.","Use Shroud of Darkness in tandem with Paranoia's dash. Your opponents may panic and waste a critical disable on your spell shield."]
