["When laning, use Void Rift to kill minions while building stacks of Organic Deconstruction on your opponent. You can then follow up with your other abilities.","Shooting Plasma Fission diagonally and splitting at maximum range allows you to hit opponents that are out of the range of the initial missile, but is more challenging to pull off.","Be very careful about when to use Life Form Disintegration Ray. Many champions have abilities that can interrupt the spell."]
