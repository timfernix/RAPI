["Kled generates courage by damaging enemies with his Pocket Pistol and basic attacks, killing minions, and attacking structures or epic monsters.","Watch Kled's courage bar when he's off his mount - when it reaches 100%, he will remount and regain a significant amount of health.","Kled is much more threatening when he has Violent Tendencies ready."]
