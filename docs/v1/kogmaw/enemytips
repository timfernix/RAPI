["Kog'Maw doesn't have a good escape ability, so he is especially prone to ganks.","Run away from Kog'Maw after he dies!!!!","The range on Living Artillery increases each rank.","Bio-Arcane Barrage allows Kog'Maw to kill Baron Nashor extremely early. It can be valuable to ward Nashor when Kog'Maw completes his Blade of the Ruined King."]
