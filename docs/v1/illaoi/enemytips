["Killing Tentacles whenever possible will make it much easier to win a fight against Illaoi.","When your spirit gets pulled out, fight back if you can. Dealing damage to Illaoi reduces the spirit's duration.","Avoid grouping up for Leap of Faith to reduce the number of Tentacles available to Illaoi."]
