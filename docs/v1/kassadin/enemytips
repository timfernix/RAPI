["Kassadin deals mostly magic damage. If he's doing well consider buying magic resist items like Mercury's Treads and Banshee's Veil.","Each time Kassadin consecutively uses Riftwalk, he pays more and more mana. Keep this in mind as you chase him.","It takes 6 spell casts for Kassadin's slow, Force Pulse, to become castable. If he levels up that ability, judiciously use your own skills while laning against him."]
