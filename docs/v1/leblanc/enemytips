["LeBlanc's ultimate can create fake LeBlancs during her spellcast or, rarely, at a distant position. ","The fake LeBlanc created at a distance will always run at the nearest Champion, cast a harmless spell, then immediately disappear.","Attacking LeBlanc first avoids most of her tricks, especially if she's recently used her dash, Distortion.","Stunning or silencing LeBlanc will prevent her from activating the return part of Distortion."]
