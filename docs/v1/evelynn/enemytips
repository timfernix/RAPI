["Purchasing Vision Wards can help you detect Evelynn's location in order to prepare for her ambushes.","A large share of Evelynn's threat is in her charm, 'Allure.' Protect allies marked with 'Allure' or, if you are marked, make sure allies are between you and where Evelynn may attack from.","If you suspect Evelynn is about to ambush one of your teammates, let them know by pinging the minimap and typing in chat."]
