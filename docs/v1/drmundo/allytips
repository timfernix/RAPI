["A well-timed Sadism can bait enemy champions into attacking you even when they lack the damage to finish you.","Spirit Visage will increase the healing done by your ultimate and lower cooldowns on all of your abilities.","Cleavers are a powerful tool for killing neutral monsters. Instead of returning to base, farm neutral monsters until your ultimate can heal you."]
