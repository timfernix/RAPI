["A fully charged Vault breaker deals double damage. If you see Vi start to charge you should back off or try to dodge it.","Vi will shred your Armor and gain Attack Speed if she manages to hit you three times in a row. Try not to engage in extended brawls with her.","Vi cannot be stopped while using her ult. Remember to save your displacement effects until after she's done charging."]
