["Attacking a ","Vulnerable"," target marked by Valor will put Harrier on cooldown. Quickly consuming Harrier marks will allow you to generate them faster.","Vault is powerful but must be used with caution, as enemies can attack Quinn when she strikes them. Vault can sometimes be used to cross terrain if your back is to a wall.","Use Behind Enemy Lines for traveling very long distances quickly, for farming minions around the map, or for chasing wounded targets."]
