["If you are affected by Blight, Varus' abilities will deal extra damage to you.","When he gets a kill or assist, Varus temporarily gains Attack Speed and is much more dangerous.","You'll get bound in place if a tendril from Varus' ultimate, Chain of Corruption, reaches you. You can cause the tendril to die however by running far enough away from it."]
