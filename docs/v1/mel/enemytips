["Mel can reflect enemy projectiles, including powerful spells. Wait until she casts Rebuttal before throwing powerful projectiles her way.","The more Mel hits you, the more Overwhelm stacks she applies. If your health drops too low her next hit will kill you, so back off for a couple seconds to let the Overwhelm stacks fall off."]
