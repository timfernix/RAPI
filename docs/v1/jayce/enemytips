["Jayce can attack in melee or at range. Pay attention to his stance and weapon color to know how he is going to attack.","If you see Jayce drop his Acceleration Gate, be careful, he is probably about to cast Shock Blast.","Jayce is strong in the early game. If he gains the advantage, play defensively."]
