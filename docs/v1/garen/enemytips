["Stack armor items to lower the large amount of physical damage that Garen deals out.","Try to run away from Garen as your health gets lower, as he can execute you quickly with Demacian Justice.","Be careful about attacking Garen in brush. It often will lead to taking full damage from Judgment.","Judgment deals maximum damage when only hitting a single target. If getting out of its radius isn't possible, move through allied minions to reduce damage taken."]
