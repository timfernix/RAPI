["Pyke is very fragile so don't be afraid to temporarily run from a fight. You can regenerate a significant amount of health from Gift of the Drowned Ones when enemies can't see you.","Hitting an enemy with the Hold version of Bone Skewer will always pull them the same distance. Use it in melee range to throw targets behind you.","The Tap version of Bone Skewer is much faster and deals additional damage.","A lot of your agressive spells are also your escapes. Make sure you always have a plan to get out of the fight."]
