["Spider Form is most effective at finishing off enemies with low health; Human Form's Neurotoxin does more damage to healthy foes. ","When in Spider Form, Spiderlings will attack the target that Elise uses Venomous Bite on. ","Elise's Spider Form and Spider Form abilities do not cost mana and can be prioritized when you are trying to conserve mana."]
