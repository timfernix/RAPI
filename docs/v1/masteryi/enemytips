["Meditate is an effective method of healing damage over time, but Master Yi is susceptible to coordinated team ganks early in the game.","If Master Yi tries to farm with Alpha Strike, hit him a few times so he has to use mana with Meditate to heal.","Although Master Yi cannot be slowed while using Highlander, other disables can stop him in his tracks."]
