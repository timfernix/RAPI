["When you see Tahm Kench use the shield from Thick Skin, remember that he just opted out of a good deal of healing. He will also not accumulate new gray health until Thick Skin comes off cooldown. Use this to your advantage!","Watch out for Kench's Abyssal Dive - you can cancel it's channel with immobilizing crowd control effects."]
