["Keep your distance to avoid being Flung back into Singed's allies.","Singed needs to run close to your team to be effective. Try to take advantage of this by using crowd control effects on him while attacking his allies.","Be careful when chasing Singed. He's very difficult to bring down, and can leave his Poison Trail to damage you in your pursuit."]
