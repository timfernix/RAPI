["Always be Attacking - In addition to dealing bonus damage, Gwen's Attacks empower or reset many of her Abilities.","Gwen can still damage enemies outside her Hallowed Mists, especially with her Ultimate's range.","Some of Gwen's Abilities can apply her passive to multiple enemies, so aim them at groups to get maximum damage and healing."]
