["Try to gank Anivia when she's laning. With multiple people, it is easier to ensure that her egg dies.","If you're playing a ranged champion, stay far enough away from Anivia so you can dodge Flash Frost more easily.","Try to fight Anivia in the lanes. In the jungle she can block pathways with lower ranks of Crystallize."]
