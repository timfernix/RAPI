Try to capitalize on windows of time when his soldiers are stationary.","Azir has immense damage over a prolonged amount of time but lacks the upfront burst of other mages. Try to burst him out before he can turn a confrontation around.","Try to think of Sand Soldiers as fire. Don't stand in the fire."]
