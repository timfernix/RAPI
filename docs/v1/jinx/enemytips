["Jinx's minigun takes time to ramp up. If you see her poking with rockets try to jump on her and burst her down.","Jinx's ultimate does less damage the closer you are to her.","Jinx's snare grenades have a long cooldown and are her primary means of protecting herself. If she misses with them she will have a hard time escaping if engaged upon. "]
