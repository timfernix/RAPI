["You can instantly use your ultimate on yourself by pressing the self cast key and the ultimate key at once (alt+R by default).","Casting Glacial Path and then running in the opposite direction will leave your enemies uncertain which way you will actually go.","Lissandra's abilities are shorter range than those of many mages. As a result, buying items that offer both ability power and defense, like Zhonya's Hourglass and Banshee's Veil, can be a great choice to help her both survive and deal damage."]
