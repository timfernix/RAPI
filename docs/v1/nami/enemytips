["Aqua Prison is a very powerful ability with a long cooldown, take advantage of the situation if Nami misses this ability.","Tidal Wave has a very long range but travels slowly, be aware of when it is coming your way as you can move out of its path.","Try to avoid fighting an opponent affected by Tidecaller's Blessing, it lasts a short duration so waiting it out can help you greatly."]
