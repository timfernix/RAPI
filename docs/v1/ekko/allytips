["Chronobreak is a potent escape tool, but it can also be quite powerful when used offensively. Don't underestimate its damage potential.","If you can proc Z-Drive Resonance on an enemy champion, it's worth taking risks to do so. The bonus Move Speed makes it easy to escape.","Phase Dive's dash is a great tool for setting up Ekko's other abilities. Use it to get double hits with Timewinder or get into position to detonate Parallel Convergence."]
